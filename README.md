#  Objective:

The main goal of this project is to examine sales data from the coffee shop to find useful information that can help improve its performance.

Sample Questions:

1. How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
2. Are there any peak times for sales activity?
3. What is the total sales revenue for each month?
4. How do sales vary across different store locations?
5. What is the average price/order per person.
6. Which products are the best-selling in terms of quantity and revenue?
7. How do sales vary by product category and type?
etc.

The above questions can be solved by analyzing graphs and we can find insights into the growth of the business.

The graph shows a clear peak in quantity ordered between 10 AM and 11 AM. During this time, the demand is highest, after the peak, the quantity ordered sharply declines after 1 PM and continues to decrease gradually until 8 PM. So the customers tend to place more orders during morning, the demand decreases as the day progresses.
